# Stock-Management-System---.NETCore-Blazor

In this project I experienced .NET Core and Blazor. In backend side firstly I designed database tables then I created models. After that I implemented repository design pattern. And finally I created API controllers. Frontend of my project consist of many components and it is a single page application.
